    <h1>cough</h1>
    <li>Causes</li>

        <li> cough is often just one symptom of a bacterial or viral infection, such as the common cold.</li>
        
       <li> Sometimes your cough can be a sign of an underlying cause such as:</li>
        
        allergies<br>
        asthma<br>
        acid reflux<br>
        chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<br>
        <li>What to do</li>
        
        <li>Antibiotics do not work against infections, such as colds, caused by viruses. Viral infections are much more common than bacterial infections. It's likely that your cough will improve within a few weeks. In the meantime you should:</li>
        
       <li>Drink more fluids, avoiding alcohol as this can make dehydration worse.</li> <li> You sweat more when you have a fever and drinking makes sure you wont get dehydrated. </li><li> should be passing urine approximately every 6 hours. A pale yellow urine means you're unlikely to be dehydrated.</li>
       <li> Take a medicine that reduces fever such as paracetamol (unless you're allergic or have been told by a healthcare professional that you can't take it).</li>
        <li> you smoke, stopping will improve your cough.</li>
        
        When to get help
        
        Contact your GP practice if any of the following happens:
        
        Your cough has lasted for more than 3 weeks<br>
        Your cough is getting worse<br>
        You have other symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, swelling or lumps in your neck or a prolonged change in your voice<br>
        You cough up blood<br>
        You have chest pain or shortness of breath<br>
        If you have any further concerns, or you develop additional symptoms, </li><br>
