<p><li> 
    HIV is a long term health condition which is now very easy to manage. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease.
    
    Nowadays, HIV treatment can stop the virus spreading and if used early enough, can reverse damage to the immune system.<BR>
    
    HIV is most commonly transmitted through having unprotected sex with someone with HIV who isn't taking HIV treatment. Unprotected sex means having sex without taking HIV PrEP or using condoms.</li>
    
    <li> can also be transmitted by:
    
    sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment
    an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding<BR></li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
        <li> How do I know if I have HIV?<BR>
    Seek healthcare advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
    
    The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or occasionally saliva for signs of the infection. In NHS services this usually involves a blood test with results available within a few days.<BR> </li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
        <li>Preventing HIV
    It has never been easier to prevent the transmission of HIV.<BR>
    
    Someone living with HIV who takes their HIV treatment and who has had an undetectable level of virus for six months, cannot transmit HIV to anyone else. Over 90% of all people diagnosed with HIV in Scotland have undetectable virus. It's therefore extremely rare for someone to get HIV from a person that knows they have the virus.<BR> </li>
    
        <li> HIV Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
    PrEP is a form of HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV which will help to prevent them from getting HIV. In Scotland PrEP is available on the NHS through sexual health clinics for people who are at risk of getting HIV. PrEP only provides protection from HIV and not from any other sexually transmitted infections.<BR></li>
    
    
    
    
    
    
        <li>Condoms (and lubricant)
    Properly used condoms (and lubricant for anal sex) are effective at preventing transmission of HIV as well as other sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.<BR></li>
    
   <li> HIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
    HIV Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a form of emergency HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV.<BR></li>
    
   <li> PEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is.<BR></li>
    
        <li>Clean Injecting Equipment
    Using fresh injecting equipment, including any needles, syringes, swabs and spoons and avoiding sharing will eliminate any risk of HIV.</p> <BR> </li>
