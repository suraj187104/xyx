        <p class="sectionsubtag text-smalll">This may seem like a silly question, but given the pervasiveness of chronic illness around it’s worth reminding ourselves.


            Our attitude towards health often appears to be one either ignorance we fail to notice just how good it feel to be healthy, a lack of awareness. Or it’s one of grudging acceptance when we realise were not as healthy as perhaps we desire to be.
            
            Even when we acknowledge the benefits of being healthy: energy, happiness, resilience on the face of adversity and societal upsets like pandemics.
            
            
            We acknowledge its role but we hate the idea, and the reality that we have to take care of ourselves to maintain our health.
            
            It’s a distraction from other more important things in life.
            
        
            
            All this comes from our cultural notion that health is only important once we’ve have lost it.
            
            But being unhealthy has a way of focusing us on ourselves and our needs. I’m no exception here, having become ill due to neglecting my health in my youth.
            
            
            So why do we fall into this trap of not valuing our health until it fails?
            
            Why do treat ourselves with so little regard until it’s a little too late?
            
            Why is health regarded as a peripheral to living well?
            
            Why is there no ‘culture of health’ in society?
            
            Like most things it’s covers many factors.
